// Rules:
//   - TakesArg: true  → the next token is consumed as the flag's value
//   - TakesArg: false → the flag is a boolean toggle
//   - Completer: "__databricks_profiles" → completes from ~/.databrickscfg sections
//   - Completer: "__files"              → completes with local file paths
//   - Short: "x"                        → also accepts -x as a short alias
